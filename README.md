# To Do List created with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript

### This project was a real struggle for me because of JavaScript
### I have practiced a lot generating DOM elements through JS even if I know there were better ways to do that using an array and pushing to it
### I have noted the points I'm week in and will improve in every one of it definitely
